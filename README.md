## Adjustable Gardening Table ##

I collaborated in a team of four to design and prototype a motorized gardening table with adjustable height (up to 20 inches) to assist individuals with physical disabilities in small-scale gardening tasks. 
We combined woodwork, CAD modeling, MATLAB programming, and hardware wiring to create a durable, ergonomic, and user-friendly structure.

- Programmed an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller in C/C++ to control four DC motors, achieving height adjustments within one to two inches
- Leveraged MATLAB to streamline code generation and enhance system efficiency and responsiveness - Designed and modeled the structure in CAD, ensuring stability and multi-directional adjustability through precise mechanical alignment
- Documented design process and testing results in a Technical Development Review (TDR) report
