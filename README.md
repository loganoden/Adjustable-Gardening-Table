## 📘 Overview
This project served as the **major semester-long design project** for ENGR 1182.01. Our team designed and prototyped a **motorized gardening table** with an adjustable height of up to **20 inches**, aimed at assisting individuals with physical disabilities in performing small-scale gardening tasks. The design integrated **woodwork, CAD modeling, MATLAB programming, and hardware wiring** to produce a durable, ergonomic, and user-friendly structure.

## ⚙️ Features and Technical Implementation
- **Microcontroller Programming:** Programmed an **Arduino Mega 2560** in **C/C++** to control four DC motors for precise height adjustments (within 1–2 inches).  
- **MATLAB Integration:** Leveraged **MATLAB** to streamline code generation and enhance system efficiency and responsiveness.  
- **Mechanical Design:** Modeled the structure in **Onshape** (CAD), ensuring stability and multi-directional adjustability through accurate mechanical alignment.  
- **Documentation:** Compiled results and analysis in a **Technical Development Review (TDR)** report, including system testing data and final prototype evaluation.
